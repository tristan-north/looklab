Texture Bake Steps
o Get uv data from alembic
o Render a red texture on 'W'
o Create new shaders for the UV render pass
o Create geo with UDIMs
o Look into using multiple render targets to render all the UDIMs


o Clean up Alembic reading, especially UVs. May be leaking memory.
o Mipmap the textures
o Add compression to texture
o Automatically set near and far clip to get max res out of depth buffer
o Check alembics with ngons etc
o Support abc hierachies more than just /obj/shape
o Adjust cam pan speed based on where you click the model like in houdini
o F key to frame geo
