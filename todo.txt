Currently
o Add param groups and param node heading.

 
Texture Baking
o Don't allocate pixels array for bake every bake
o UDIM support, look into using multiple render targets to render all the UDIMs
o Expand the bake to avoid edge artifacts from filtering
o Read in the baked texture to openGl and reset the draw line


o Assert everywhere
o Currently if rotating with alt+click and let go of alt it starts painting.
o Clean up Alembic reading, especially UVs. May be leaking memory.
o Currently rendered image is updated on a timer, maybe better to do it with a signal, but limit the signals to no more than 30 times/sec.
o Mipmap the textures for use in prman
o Add compression to texture
o Automatically set near and far clip to get max res out of depth buffer
o Check alembics with ngons etc
o Support abc hierachies more than just /obj/shape
o Adjust cam pan speed based on where you click the model like in houdini
o F key to frame geo
